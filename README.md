# Clipboard Data Formatter
Takes data from clipboard, formats it, puts it back to clipboard

When run, takes data from clipboard and reformats it to be enclosed by brackets and separated by a comma and space. It then copies the output back to the clipboard.

Useful for taking data from sources such as https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/ or spreadsheets and pasting it into Python scripts as a list of tuples to plot it.

Note the decimal separator must be a period.
